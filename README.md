# Quick_3D_MMORPG

This was a refactoring of simon's original project. It's now just me following my own nose. Currently loving using threlte 🛠️⛏️⚔️

# Branching off?

It's a simple node setup, run `npm i` then `npm run dev` to get started.

If you were looking for what this repo looked like before threlte, [here's the repo deployed serverless](https://github.com/DefinitelyMaybe/glowing-octo-train) and have a look back through the commit history for the corresponding commits.
